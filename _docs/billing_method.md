Billing Method

    Currently, Kling only offers the option to purchase prepaid resource packages.
    The resource packages are categorized into three types based on “capabilities”: video generation package, image generation package, and virtual try-on package.
Prepaid Resource Packs
Video Generation Resource Package

    Description: A general-purpose credit package for video generation.
    Usage: Enables access to image generation API capabilities, including text-to-video, image-to-video, video-extension and lip-sync.
    Credit Price: The standard price for each video generation credit is $0.14 USD.
    Validity Period: Each package comes with a specific activation and expiration date. Once expired, unused credits will become invalid and cannot be used.
    Concurrency: Refers to the number of videos that can be generated simultaneously.
    Package Tiers: Within the same validity period, the more credits and higher concurrency a package offers, the lower the discount. Three basic package tiers are available as a reference. (For business customization or bulk purchases, please contact us through official channels.)
