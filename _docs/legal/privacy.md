Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know or delete related to your personal data.

You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must:

    Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal data or an authorized representative, which may include: your identification information, a signed permission authorizing the representative to submit the request on your behalf, and any other information permitted or recommended by the CCPA and applicable regulations.
    Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal data relates to you.

We will only use personal data provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

Response Timing and Format regarding Requests to Know or Delete

We will confirm receipt of your request within [fifteen (15)] business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the [fifteen (15)] business days timeframe, please contact us via the contact details displayed in the “CONTACT US” section.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA.

To exercise your right to opt-out provided under CCPA, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by using the contact information provided in “Contact Information” of this Policy.

We will only use personal data provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
