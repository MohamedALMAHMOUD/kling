Advantages of Video Generation
Highlight 1	Generation of Significant and Realistic Motion
Kling employs a 3D spatio-temporal joint attention mechanism, which enables it to better model complex spatio-temporal movements in videos. As a result, Kling can not only generate significant motion but also adhere more closely to the natural laws of motion.	
	
Highlight 2	Minute-Long Video Generation
Benefiting from efficient training infrastructure, extreme inference optimization, and scalable foundational architecture, Kling can generate videos up to 3 minutes long.	
	
Highlight 3	More Accurate Simulation of Physical World Characteristics
Kling’s large model utilizes a 3D spatiotemporal joint attention mechanism, which enhances its ability to model the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics present in videos.Therefore, Keling’s large model is capable of generating movements with a significant range and is more aligned with the laws of motion.	
	
Highlight 4	Strong Conceptual Combination Ability and Imagination
Leveraging the model’s deep understanding of text-video semantics and the robust conceptual combination capabilities learned from the Diffusion Transformer architecture, Keling’s large model can transform users’ rich imagination into concrete imagery.	
	
Vivid and Natural Lip-Sync Capability

The lip-sync feature can perfectly synchronize the lip movements of characters in videos generated by Kling AI with locally recorded or online-generated dubbing/singing files, achieving the effect of real people speaking or singing, and making the video appear lifelike!
Advantages of Lip-Sync
	

    Naturally and Highly Matched Lip Movements: The lip movements of characters in the generated video not only synchronize precisely with the audio but also create unique movement trajectories based on individual facial features and physiological structures, significantly enhancing the video’s naturalness and realism.
    Clear Facial Muscle Texture: The changes in lip movements accurately drive the facial muscles, adjusting in real-time and meticulously presenting the stretching and contraction of muscles during lip movement, resulting in a highly coordinated visual effect that further enhances the overall realism and immersive quality of the video.
    Vivid and Lifelike Imagery: The areas outside the face in the generated video remain consistent with the original video, ensuring the integrity and continuity of the original footage, avoiding interference with non-target areas during the generation process, and restoring the original appearance of the video to the greatest extent possible.

Engaging and entertaining video special effects capabilities

Kling AI has launched its Single Image Effects and Dual-character Effects capabilities. The Single Image Effects allows users to upload an image containing human subjects or objects to instantly generate two types of effect videos: “squish” and “expansion” . The Dual-character Effects enables users to upload two portrait photos to automatically create three types of affectionate interaction videos: “Hug”, “Kiss”, and “Heart_gesture”, delivering realistic, natural, and entertaining visual experiences.

Advanced Virtual Try-On Capability

Virtual Try-on is powered by our image-generation model, integrating technologies that preserve clothing SKUs, adjust human poses, and restore backgrounds. It enables users to generate try-on effects for any clothing, body shape, and pose. Even with complex backgrounds, high-quality try-on results can be achieved.
Advantages of Virtual Try-on
	

    Preserving Clothing Styles& Details: With Kolors Virtual Try-on, users can “try on” a wide range of clothing, from tops to dresses. The model can retain details like patterns, texts, and designs, ensuring the virtual try-on experience matches the real one.
    Natural Try-on Effects: Kolors Virtual Try-on can create realistic and natural fitting effects. Users can “dress” 2D clothing in any setting, whether indoors or outdoors, with results that adhere to the laws of physics, making it look seamless and lifelike.
    Full Process Generation: Powered by Kolors’ image-generation large model, the system can generate models of different ages, genders, and ethnicities, while adapting to various backgrounds, catering to global e-commerce needs. Additionally, leveraging Kling’s powerful image-to-video model, it can transform model photos into short videos, enabling full-process generation from image to video.
